title: An introduction to Eidos Meetings and why you need to join
author: Staff @ Eidos.events
date: June 2022
abstract: Many young researchers tend to work in isolated environments, relating only to the people of their lab and field of knowledge. That along with the many hardships that go along with many PhD programs can lead to feelings from stress, loneliness and even despair. It's been proved that sharing experiences and feelings with like minded individual does help in coping with stress and having the chance to engage with individuals from different fields of work may enhance innovation. Thus in the following work we propose a meeting format, novel in Madrid where young researchers may expand their social networks to solve the presented issues :)

    Starting a career in science whatever the field is never something easy, we usually do it not for the money, nor for the fame but because we are very passionate about what we do. And that comes at a price, usually we may feel a bit isolated in our work or research groups having a hard time finding related individuals in other fields of knowledge. On the other hand, being connected to individuals who share those same values and concerns may come in very handy when it comes to dealing with stress, looking for opportunities or starting joint projects... or just starting new friendships! It can add a lot of value to your life [0].
    Thats why we came up with this idea. We think that it will be awesome to have the chance to meet with like minded individuals at least once a month and talk about the mysteries of life, the future, our research and solve the worlds problems together while we enjoy some nice food and drinks in Madrid. Oh and the name EIDOS comes from the Greek and refeers to the <i>distinctive expression of the cognitive or intellectual character of a culture or social group</i> and we just thought it sounds cool.

<p class="SubSection">2 &ensp;Methodology: How does it work?</p>

<p class="BodyText">
    It's a no brainer: We will try to hold at least a dinner per month usually on Thursdays Fridays or Saturdays at places not so expensive and easily reachable by public transport in Madrid. If you want to attend to any of those you'll have to <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgVfVDoRmijsicUUPtZG-V1AcGEnxcX7jIdYdkNWub846v_g/viewform'> sign up by using a simple form</a> [1]. We will ask you some basic questions about yourself that will be used to set up the events, that is, to seat you near interesting people, to help you socialize if you need it, to set the menu and pick the place, etc. After signing up we will mail you the address and time for the next event(s) at least a week in advance. You'll need to confirm your attendance. We'll try to make it max 20 people for event. The events will usually start with small presentations and some games so we can get to know each other and may end with small debates over common topics of interest. We will send you all the needed info before hand. After the event we may ask you to give us some feedback and will of course let you know about future events, unless you not want to :) The more people interested the better it will work! So sign up and tell your friends about it.

<p class="SubSection">3 &ensp; Why do I need to join?</p>
<p class="BodyText">
The answer is simple: We think that you may like to join because it will be an opportunity to know new people who are in some way like you, to share your doubts and concerns and to maybe find some collaborations or joint projects, or just to spend a nice evening and make new friends! Giving it a bit of thought we came with this list of reasons:
</p>
<ul style="color:#00008b;font-size:27px">
    <li style="padding:0.7em">You are a curious person and want to expand your intellectual horizons</li>
    <li style="padding:0.7em">You want to have meaningful conversations</li>
    <li style="padding:0.7em">You want to engage with like-minded individuals who are on the same page as you</li>
    <li style="padding:0.7em">You feel that your studies/research are taking a toll on your social life</li>
    <li style="padding:0.7em">You feel overwhelmed doing your PhD and want to share your situation with people on the same situation</li>
    <li style="padding:0.7em">You are a bit lost no knowing what to do after finishing your thesis/postdoc</li>
    <li style="padding:0.7em">You want to explore new opportunities for collaborations in research/work projects</li>
</ul>



<p class="SubSection">4 &ensp; Discussion: FAQS</p>

Though we tried to provide a simple explaination, we know that you folks have many questions. Here's the frequently asked ones:

<p class="BodyText2Col Justified">
    <b>Where will the meetings be held? </b> We will book quiet spaces at nice (but not expensive) restaurants in the city centre of Madrid, easy to access by metro. As the <i>critical mass</i> grows, we will come up with <i>more fancy</i> ideas ;) (stay connected)
    <br><b>Do I need to pay anything? </b> This is all for free, non profit for us. You'll only need to pay for what you eat/drink and that is all
    <br><b>Will this be about dinners only?</b> At first yes. We (and probably you) have plenty of ideas but lets let it come naturally :)
    <br><b>Will this lead to a Whatsapp group or something?</b> Eventhough we are not against the creation of groups in any chat platform the endgame of these meetings is not to create a group that will be used to send memes during a couple of weeks and will fall into oblivion. Conversely, we aim to create a small and <b>serious</b> community that will provide meaningful content to its members.
    <br><b>Are the meetings held in english?</b> No, not really. <b>The meetings will be held mostly in spanish</b> we employ english in here just to make sure we don't miss any international researchers/students. During the events you can talk in any language you feel comfortable with, english and spanish will work well 
    <br><b>What if I am a shy person?</b> Worry not. If you sign up you'll have to tell us a bit about yourself. As we do that with each of the participants, so we will be able to help you connecting with the rest of the attendees and believe us, we will put an effort in that. <b>Introverts be welcome!</b>
    <br><b>What if I want to get involved in the organization?</b> Just sign up and come to any of our events and talk to us! Or simply write to <i>redeidosscience AT gmail DOT com</i>
    <br><b>Is this for STEM people only?</b> Not at all. All fields of knowledge are very welcome. We think that connecting someone with a background in let's say sociology to someone like a computer scientist or a biologist can lead to really amazing conversations! So don't hesitate and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgVfVDoRmijsicUUPtZG-V1AcGEnxcX7jIdYdkNWub846v_g/viewform">JOIN</a> [1]
    <br><b>Is there any script or program for the events?</b> We'll do some initial presentations and may even have some small games to get people to know each other.  Other than that we'll try to let things flow as much as possible :)
    <br><b>Can someone not in academia join?</b> Unfortunately not at this time as these events are focused on connecting people involved in resesearch, especially those in an early stage of their careers. Eventhough that, we will consider expanding our reach and including researchers in the industry in the near future 
    <br><b>Who is behind this? </b> A small group of friends on our (we hope) last year of the PhD :) Pau, Edu and Andrea from Autonoma and Complutense with backgrounds in artificial intelligence, environmental science and nuclear physics
